# Eva Solska || Writer

Eva Solska || Writer is a website-portfolio for the ukrainian author of books for kids and teens.

## ðŸŒŸ About the Project
In these days of digital technology, books are becoming increasingly unpopular and children are not reading them. I created a website for a Ukrainian children's and teenage book writer to promote reading and attract the attention of potential readers to Ukrainian literature.

I made the site because I myself am part of these books. The writer is a friend of my family and we are all primary readers and do our part by giving feedback.
