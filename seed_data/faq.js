        question: "Why did you become a writer?",
        answer: "I did not become a writer.  In my opinion, this is impossible. Just one day I allowed myself to BE a writer, letting out the stories that had always lived inside me."

        question: "Why do you write specifically for children?",
        answer: "Because some part of me has not grown up like that. And also, because I want to preserve the ability to rejoice and wonder.  And be happy.  Here and now.  Without any reason."

        question: "The action of the first part of the trilogy 'Letty Gwyngill' takes place in North Wales.  Where does this fascination with Welsh culture come from?",
        answer: "The Welsh are very similar to us Ukrainians.  They are just as stubborn and stubborn. Despite numerous attempts by conquerors (from the Romans to the British) to destroy their culture, the Cymra (as the people of Wales call themselves) still live on the island and speak their ancient language.  - Yma o hyd!  (We are still here!) - they like to talk about themselves.  In this phrase - the whole history of Wales and the spirit of its proud people."

        question: "Why druids?",
        answer: "Druids combine three things I love very much: ancient magic, fascination with trees and mystery. The order of Celtic priests actually existed, but there is almost no objective information about Druids left.  Therefore, it was a double challenge for me both as a writer and as a scientist: to find what can be found and to imagine something else, but in such a way that the real is impossible (or at least difficult) to distinguish from the imagined."

        question: "What message do your books convey to readers?",
        answer: "Don't be afraid to be different.  Listen to your heart.  Make friends and love sincerely and truly.  In whatever world we are.  Because, in fact, our world is in the middle of each of us."
